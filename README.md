Monthly expenditure of families living in a neighborhood was collected and stored in a dataset for experimental purposes. The data is stored in the dataset 'Household data' in an .xlxs format.  Along with the variable expenditure, the dataset also contains other four features also, features that may affect the expenditure of the family. The dataset is composed of 50 observations of 50 families with 5 different features or columns. So we need to set up a perfect regression model to explain the monthly expenditure using other variables. 

The dataset has information on monthly expenditure, annual income of the household, monthly income, household size (number of members in the household), and monthly EMI. So we need to set up a perfect regression model to explain the monthly expenditure using other variables or features in the dataset. This regression model can further use for most efficient prediction of monthly expenditure based on the other variables selected in the model. Here we need to set up a best-fit regression model based on a regression equation and need to calculate the fittest and balanced coefficient values corresponding to the regressor variables.
