## Household-expenditure-prediction


Household expenditure prediction using linear regression

The dataset has information on monthly expenditure, annual income of the household, monthly income, household size (number of members in the household), and monthly EMI. So we need to set up a perfect regression model to explain the monthly expenditure using other variables or features in the dataset. This regression model can further use for most efficient prediction of monthly expenditure based on the other variables selected in the model. Here we need to set up a best-fit regression model based on a regression equation and need to calculate the fittest and balanced coefficient values corresponding to the regressor variables.
